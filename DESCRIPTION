Description: Provides researchers with a simple set of diagnostic tools for monitoring the progress and reliability of raters conducting content coding tasks. Goehring (2024) <https://bengoehring.github.io/improving-content-analysis-tools-for-working-with-undergraduate-research-assistants.pdf> argues that supervisors---especially supervisors of small teams---should utilize computational tools to monitor reliability in real time. As such, this package provides easy-to-use functions for calculating inter-rater reliability statistics and measuring the reliability of one coder compared to the rest of the team.
