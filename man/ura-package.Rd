\title{ura: Monitoring Rater Reliability}
\description{
Provides researchers with a simple set of diagnostic tools for monitoring the progress and reliability of raters conducting content coding tasks. Goehring (2023) \url{https://bengoehring.github.io/files/ps-paper-anon-word-ca.docx} argues that supervisors---especially supervisors of small teams---should utilize computational tools to monitor reliability in real time. As such, this package provides easy-to-use functions for calculating inter-rater reliability statistics and measuring the reliability of one coder compared to the rest of the team.
